<p>This game initially started as our entry for the Liberated Pixel Cup 2012
  (See <a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org">http://lpc.opengameart.org</a>).
  Back then it was called 'Lurking Patrol Comrades' and it is a massive
  multiplayer online roleplay game.</p>

<h2>Starting the game</h2>

<p>We are using manasource technology as our engine, so you need to install
  the mana client. However, playing the game is only possible with our modded
  client. See the <a href="https://github.com/tales/sourceoftales/wiki/Installation-of-client">wiki</a> for install instructions.</p>

<p>Once you have the mana client installed, connect to server
  testing.manasource.org with server type ManaServ at Port 9601.</p>
