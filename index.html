<p>This game initially started as our entry for the Liberated Pixel Cup 2012.
(see <a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org">http://lpc.opengameart.org</a>)
Back then it was called 'Lurking Patrol Comrades'
It is a massive multiplayer online roleplay game.</p>

<h1>Starting the game</h1>

<p>We are using manasource technology as our engine, so you need to install
the mana client.</p>

<p>Currently, playing the game is only possible with our modded client. See
  the wiki for install instructions.</p>

<p>Once you have the mana client installed, connect to server
  testing.manasource.org with server type ManaServ at Port 9601.</p>

<p>There you go.</p>
