<h1>Source of Tales</h1>
<p>This game initially started as our entry for the Liberated Pixel Cup 2012
  (See <a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org">http://lpc.opengameart.org</a>).
  Back then it was called 'Lurking Patrol Comrades' and it is a massive
  multiplayer online roleplay game.</p>

<h2>Starting the game</h2>

<p>We are using manasource technology as our engine, so you need to install
  the mana client. However, playing the game is only possible with our modded
  client. See the wiki for install instructions.</p>

<p>Once you have the mana client installed, connect to server
  testing.manasource.org with server type ManaServ at Port 9601.</p>
